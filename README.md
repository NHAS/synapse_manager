On taking any of these actions an admin username and password will be needed to be entried via stdin. 

This will then be used to connect to the synapse server to get an authorization token to thus perform the action. 

While the purge API has now been fixed, some rooms that have been created have users joined to them, which stops a room from being purged. There is an API to shutdown a room and kick all people, however this creates a new room. Which.... kind of defeats the purpose of things to begin with.
